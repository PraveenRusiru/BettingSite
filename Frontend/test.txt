That’s a very good question 👌 and a common confusion when mixing external APIs with your own database design.

Here’s the key point:
👉 Even if you pull match details from an API, you still need a Match table in your ER diagram, because:
	1.	Your system must have a logical data model (ERD) showing how entities relate (Users → Bets → Matches → Outcomes).
	2.	API data is just a source; once you fetch it, you’ll likely store some/all of it in your DB for betting operations (odds, bets, history).
	3.	Without a Match entity, your Bet table wouldn’t know what match the bet belongs to.

✅ Example Simplified ER Model for Betting
	•	User (bettor)
	•	Bet (placed by a user, linked to a match & specific market)
	•	Match (fetched from API, stored in your DB at least partially)
	•	Market / Bet Type (e.g., “Winner”, “Runs in Over 5”, “Next Wicket”)
	•	Odds (for each market option)

Relationships:
	•	User (1) --- (M) Bet
	•	Match (1) --- (M) Market
	•	Market (1) --- (M) Bet
	•	Market (1) --- (M) Odds

🏏 Example with Cricket
	•	Match Table
	•	match_id (PK)
	•	team1, team2
	•	start_time, status
	•	api_ref_id (to map with external API)
@Builder
@Data
@AllArgsConstructor
@NoArgsConstructor
@Entity
public class Matches {
    @Id
    private String matchId;
    private String matchSeries;
    private String team1;
    private String team2;
    private String location;
    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    private MatchFormat matchFormat;
    private boolean isLive;
}
	•	Market Table
	•	market_id (PK)
	•	match_id (FK → Match)
	•	type (e.g., “Runs in Over”, “Match Winner”)
	
	@Entity
@Builder
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
@Data
public class Market {
    @Id
    private String id;
    private String type;
    @ManyToOne(cascade=CascadeType.ALL)
    @JoinColumn(name="match_id")
    private Matches match;
}

    •	Bet Table
	•	bet_id (PK)
	•	user_id (FK → User)
	•	market_id (FK → Market)
	•	odds_at_time
	•	stake, potential_return, status


	@Data
@AllArgsConstructor
@NoArgsConstructor
@Entity
public class Bet {
    @Id
    private String betId;
    private Date date;
    private Time time;
    private String stake;
    private double amount;
    private double potential_return;
    private String status;
    @ManyToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    @JoinColumn(name="market_id")
    private Market market;
    @ManyToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    @JoinColumn(name="user_id")
    private User user;
}

⚡ How it Works in Practice
	1.	API → You pull match info (teams, schedule, scores).
	2.	Store it in your Match table (so you can reference it later).
	3.	Your system adds markets for that match (e.g., Winner, Runs in Over X).
	4.	Users place bets on those markets.

So yes ✅ having a Match table is absolutely correct for your ER diagram — even if the raw data comes from an API.
